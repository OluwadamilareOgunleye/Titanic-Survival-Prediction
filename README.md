# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
This project uses the famous Titanic dataset to predict which passengers survived the disaster using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing passenger details such as age, class, and gender, we aim to build a predictive model that can estimate survival chances.

## Problem Statement
The Titanic disaster resulted in the loss of over 1500 lives. Understanding the factors that contributed to survival can help improve safety measures on future voyages. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of survival based on passenger characteristics.

## Data Source
- Dataset: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

## Methodology
1. Data Collection from Kaggle.
2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Handling Missing Values, Encoding).
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
4. Model Selection & Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM).
5. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix).
6. Prediction & Kaggle Submission (optional).

## Key Insights
- Women had a significantly higher survival rate.
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive than 3rd class.
- Children had better survival chances than adults.
- Passengers boarding at different ports had different survival rates.

## Conclusion / Recommendations
- Passenger class, gender, and age were the strongest predictors of survival.
- Future maritime safety policies can focus on:
    - Prioritizing family evacuations.
    - Providing clearer evacuation plans for lower-class passengers.
    - Improving access to lifeboats for all passengers.
